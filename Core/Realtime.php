/**
 * Where a browser should connect for live updates.
 *
 * Why this is not simply a config value
 * -------------------------------------
 * The realtime server listens on its own port, so its URL is never same-origin
 * and cannot be expressed as a relative path. A single hard-coded value works
 * only as long as every client reaches the server by the same name.
 *
 * On a school LAN they do not. The machine running the system opens the console
 * at http://localhost:8080; every other device — the head teacher's laptop, a
 * phone in the corridor — reaches it at http://192.168.1.x:8080. Handing those
 * devices "ws://localhost:8443" tells each of them to connect to *itself*,
 * which fails silently and leaves the connection indicator on "Connecting"
 * forever, with no error a non-technical administrator could act on.
 *
 * So the endpoint follows the host the browser actually used, unless an
 * explicit REALTIME_WS_PUBLIC_URL is configured — which is what a real
 * deployment behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy needs, and which therefore
 * always wins.
