/**
 * The Content-Security-Policy nonce for the current request.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * The policy sets `script-src 'self'`, which forbids inline <script> blocks.
 * The layouts and roughly forty views legitimately need one: the per-page
 * bootstrap object (`window.__LSIAMS_CONFIG__`) carries the CSRF token, the
 * realtime URL and the idle-timeout values into the page, and the page-specific
 * behaviour lives in a <script> block at the bottom of each view.
 *
 * Without a nonce the browser silently refused every one of those blocks. The
 * bootstrap never ran, so `LSIAMS.config.csrfToken` stayed at its empty default,
 * so every AJAX POST presented an empty token and the server answered 419
 * "your session security token expired" — an error that describes a session
 * problem for what was really a policy problem. The realtime URL was likewise
 * never set, so the connection indicator sat on "Connecting" forever, and every
 * button whose handler lived in a view-level script did nothing at all.
 *
 * Relaxing the policy to 'unsafe-inline' would have fixed the symptoms and
 * removed the single most valuable defence this application has against
 * reflected XSS. A nonce keeps the defence: the browser executes exactly the
 * inline scripts this server emitted on this request, and nothing an attacker
 * manages to inject, because the attacker cannot know a value generated per
 * response from a CSPRNG.
