/**
 * The hand-off between the enrolment screen and the sensor.
 *
 * Enrolment used to be a form: an administrator stood at the terminal, drove the
 * sensor by some other means, read the slot number off it and typed that number
 * into the browser. Nothing connected the two halves, so nothing stopped a typo
 * from binding a teacher to somebody else's finger.
 *
 * Here the browser opens a request against a terminal, the terminal picks it up
 * on its next poll and runs the sensor's own capture cycle, and the slot comes
 * back from the sensor rather than from a keyboard. The administrator never
 * types a number.
 *
 * What is still true: no biometric template reaches this server. The request
 * carries the slot the template must occupy; the template stays in the sensor's
 * flash, and this database records only which teacher owns which slot.
