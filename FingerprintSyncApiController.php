/**
 * Handing a terminal the templates it is missing.
 *
 * A sensor can only match what is in its own flash, so a teacher enrolled in
 * Room 101 was unknown to the reader in Room 102. This is how the template
 * gets there: the terminal asks what it is short of, writes what it is given
 * into its sensor, and confirms.
 *
 * Pull, not push — the same shape as enrolment and card issuance. The server
 * never opens a connection to a terminal, so a terminal that is switched off
 * collects its backlog when it returns rather than needing the server to track
 * retries.
 *
 * This route sends biometric templates over the wire, which nothing else in
 * this system does. What guards it:
 *
 *   · the full device-auth chain — a registered device id, a valid API key, an
 *     HMAC signature over the request, a fresh timestamp and a single-use
 *     nonce. A terminal cannot ask on another terminal's behalf, because the
 *     device it is answered for comes from the authenticated identity and
 *     never from the request body.
 *   · one template per call, addressed to one slot on that terminal.
 *   · TLS in any deployment that has it. On a plain-HTTP LAN this is the one
 *     endpoint where that choice actually costs something, and DEPLOYMENT.md
 *     says so.
