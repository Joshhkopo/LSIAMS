/**
 * Part 18.2 — the authoritative idle-timeout check.
 *
 * Runs on every authenticated request, before any controller. The order below
 * is exactly the specified sequence:
 *
 *   1. terminated?        → 401 SESSION_TERMINATED
 *   2. past absolute?     → terminate, 401
 *   3. past idle?         → terminate, 401
 *   4. counts as activity → extend the deadline
 *
 * Step 4 is where the security property actually lives. A teacher who opens the
 * live attendance dashboard and walks away is not present, so passive refreshes
 * — the live feed, chart polling, notification badges, WebSocket traffic — must
 * not extend the session. Those requests carry `X-Passive-Request: true` and
 * are honoured here. If they reset the timer instead, the session would never
 * expire and the entire control would be defeated.
