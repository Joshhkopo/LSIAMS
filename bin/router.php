 * Router for PHP's built-in web server, which start.bat uses so the system
 * runs without configuring Apache.
 *
 * The built-in server hands *every* request to its router script, including
 * ones for files that plainly exist — so without this, a request for
 * /assets/css/app.css reaches the front controller, gets routed like a page,
 * and comes back as a 404 in text/html. The site renders as unstyled markup.
 *
 * Apache does the same job with the "serve existing files directly" rewrite in
 * public/.htaccess; nginx equivalents are in docs/DEPLOYMENT.md. The built-in
 * server reads neither, so the rules that matter are repeated here.
