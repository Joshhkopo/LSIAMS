/**
 * Environment probe for start.bat.
 *
 * start.bat used to ask these questions with inline `php -r "..."` snippets,
 * one of them nested inside a FOR /F. That put PHP source through two layers of
 * cmd.exe quote-stripping, and when a machine mangled it the result was:
 *
 *     PHP Parse error: syntax error, unexpected end of file ... on line 1
 *     [ok] PHP error:
 *
 * — a parse error from the probe, and the "version" printed as the second word
 * of the error message. Nothing was wrong with PHP; the launcher had simply
 * failed to ask. Moving the questions into a file removes every layer of
 * quoting between the batch file and the code, so there is nothing left to
 * mangle.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   php bin/env-check.php version     prints "8.2.4", exits 0
 *                                     exits 1 if older than 8.1
 *   php bin/env-check.php required    prints any missing required extensions
 *                                     exits 1 if any are missing
 *   php bin/env-check.php optional    prints any missing optional extensions
 *                                     exits 1 if any are missing
 *   php bin/env-check.php database    exits 0 if the database answers
 *
 * Kept free of the framework except where the check itself needs it: a
 * launcher that cannot boot the application still has to be able to say why.
