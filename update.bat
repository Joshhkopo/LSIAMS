REM ===========================================================================
REM  L-SIAMS - get the latest version
REM
REM  Double-click this instead of deleting the folder and downloading the ZIP
REM  again. It fetches only what actually changed - usually a few kilobytes
REM  rather than the whole project - and applies any new database changes.
REM
REM  Your own settings survive every update. The .env file, the student and
REM  teacher photos, the generated reports, the backups and the database
REM  itself are not part of the download and are never touched here.
REM
REM  The first run links this folder to GitHub. After that, updating is
REM  double-click, wait a few seconds, done.

REM ------------------------------------------------------------- linking ---
REM A folder unzipped from GitHub has no .git directory, so it has no idea
REM where it came from. This attaches it to the repository in place, which
REM keeps the .env file and everything else that is not in version control.
REM The prompt below is deliberately not inside an if(...) block. Batch expands
REM %VAR% when it parses a whole block, which is before any line in that block
REM runs - so a %LINK% read back next to the `set /p` that fills it is always
REM the value from before the prompt, i.e. empty. A label sidesteps it.

echo   This folder came from a ZIP download, so it is not linked
echo   to GitHub yet. Linking it now means every future update is
echo   just a double-click.
echo.

echo   not part of the repository and will be left alone. Any edit
echo   you have made to the program files themselves will be
