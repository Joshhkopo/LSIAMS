/**
 * The terminal's half of fingerprint enrolment.
 *
 * An idle terminal polls `pending`; when it is handed a request it runs the
 * R307's capture cycle, reports each step through `progress`, and finishes with
 * `complete` or `failed`. Every route here runs the full device-auth chain, so
 * a terminal can only ever speak about a request addressed to itself.
 *
 * The device is told which slot to write and reports back which slot it wrote.
 *
 * It now also reports back the template itself, which it deliberately did not
 * before. A template that lives only in one sensor's flash makes its teacher a
 * stranger to every other classroom, and there was no fix for that short of
 * walking them round the building. The upload is what lets FingerprintSyncService
 * put the same finger on every terminal.
 *
 * That is a real change in exposure and it is documented as one — see migration
 * 018 and docs/SECURITY.md. The field is optional, so a terminal on older
 * firmware still enrols successfully; its teacher simply stays local to that
 * sensor.
