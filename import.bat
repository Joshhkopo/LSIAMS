REM  L-SIAMS - import a .sql file into the database
REM
REM  Drag a .sql file onto this icon, or double-click it and type the path
REM  when asked. Works with phpMyAdmin exports.
REM
REM  The file lands in the database named in .env, whatever the file itself
REM  says, and foreign key checks are switched off while it runs - so the
REM  order the tables appear in does not matter.
