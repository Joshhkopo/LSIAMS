/* ===========================================================================
 * L-SIAMS — RFID bench test
 *
 * A deliberately small sketch that proves one thing end to end: a card tapped
 * on the MFRC522 reaches the server, is authenticated, and comes back with the
 * server's decision. No fingerprint, no display, no offline queue, no state
 * machine — when this works, the hard part (request signing) is proven, and
 * the full terminal firmware is the same call wrapped in more behaviour.
 *
 * It differs from the production firmware in two ways, both on purpose:
 *
 *   1. Plain HTTP. The production firmware always opens a WiFiClientSecure,
 *      which cannot talk to the `php -S` development server on port 8080.
 *      This one picks the client from the URL scheme, so http:// works on the
 *      bench and https:// still works against a deployment.
 *
 *   2. It bootstraps its clock from the HTTP `Date` response header. Every
 *      signed request must carry a timestamp within 30 seconds of server time,
 *      and an ESP32 boots believing it is 1 January 1970 — so the very first
 *      request is unsignable without a clock, and NTP is not available on a
 *      school LAN with no route to the internet.
 *
 *      `Date` solves it: HTTP puts it on every response including the 401 that
 *      rejects an unsigned request, so one throwaway call yields the server's
 *      wall clock to the second. The exact epoch is then taken from
 *      GET /api/device/time once signing works.
 *
 *      The obvious alternative does not currently work. DeviceAuthMiddleware
 *      attaches `server_epoch` to its TIMESTAMP_EXPIRED rejection specifically
 *      so a device can correct itself, but App::respondHttp() returns early for
 *      every 401 through Response::fail(), which drops the context — the field
 *      never reaches the wire. Verified against a live server: that body comes
 *      back as "data":[].
 *
 * Wiring (MFRC522 → ESP32, SPI):
 *      SDA/SS → GPIO 5      SCK → GPIO 18     MOSI → GPIO 23
 *      MISO   → GPIO 19     RST → GPIO 27
 *      3.3V   → 3V3  (NEVER 5V — 5 V destroys the module)
 *      GND    → GND
 *
 * Libraries: MFRC522 by GithubCommunity, ArduinoJson v7.
 * Board: ESP32 Dev Module.
